# **Kloe_Dilase_Position_List**
Position list builder for Kloe Dilase lithography software

# **This Read Me**

<p class="text-justify">This README file is designed to assist both those with little python knowledge and those confident with python.

# **Position_List.py Script**

<p class="text-justify">Position_List.py is a python 3 script that allows a Kloe Dilase user to build a position list and matrix copy to fill out a chip/sample with the same initial position list. The script allows for multiple matrix copies through adding more position arrays and using the repeat_position_list function repeatedly.

## **How The Script Works**

### **Setting the File Path**

<p class="text-justify">Initially the script looks for the current working directory, this should be changed depending on your machine. For me this involved creating a directory for my position lists. Choose your own destination by altering the position_list_dir directory path.<br>The Kloe-specific directory path follows. For our system this involves the Kloe user's name as a low-tier directory, and the directory LITHO FILES. The Dilase software requires a complete file path to pull the designs into the system. It is a requirement, therefore, that your file_name variable contains the disk (for windows users), and any sub-directories down to the LWO file. LWO file name must be specified too.

### **Initial Position**

<p class="text-justify">As with the Kloe Dilase software position list builder, it is often advisable, when copying the same pattern (with our without different write parameters), to start with a single object, build a small pattern first and then matrix copy.<br>That is exactly how this code is designed to work. The user gives initial x,y,z coordinates, modulation and velocity for the first object. These are given in a python dictionary, referred to in the code as position_initial. The file path is carried through into the dictionary automatically, and the user specifies the desired laser line.<br>The initial parameters are specified, and carried through the code, in the same order they appear within the Kloe Dilase software itself.

### **Matrix Copying**

<p class="text-justify">There are two matrix copy functions given within this code, one that takes the dictionary input from position initial and one that takes a position list array. Both functions perform the same task, with the only difference being the input method.<br>The position_list function is fed directly by the position_initial dictionary. This function is designed to repeat in either x or y, with a modulation or velocity change, but is capable of dealing with an x and y and a modulation and velocity change. The function uses a step function to repeat the initial pattern, which is managed by an array, known as pattern_shift. The pattern_shift array is laid out as follows:

pattern_shift = [modulation, velocity, x, y, z, repeats]

where:<br>
modulation = the step in modulation with each repeat<br>
velocity = the step in velocity with each repeat<br>
x, y, z = the step in x-, y- and z- position with each repeat<br>
repeats = the number of repeat patterns (not including the origin)<br>

<p class="text-justify">The position_list function writes the initial position list and then repeats the pattern with parameter modifications decsribed above. Therefore repeats only controls the number of repeat patterns, and does not account for the original. In other words, repeats=10 results in 11 patterns.<br>The repeat_position_list functions works in exactly the same way, but can only have an array as its input. The output of position_list is an array, where each entry is a string (line within the Kloe Position List) containing the laser, modulation, velocity, x, y, z parameters in the required format. The repeat_position_list function can be used any number of times depending on user requirements. repeat_position_list is managed by an array in the same way as above.
